# 🏦 Customer Bank Churn Prediction  

This is my **Machine Learning project**!  
I built a churn prediction model to identify whether a customer is likely to leave the bank. The goal was to practice **data preprocessing, model training, and deployment basics** in Python.  

---

## 📌 Project Objective  
To develop a machine learning model that predicts **customer churn** based on demographic and banking-related attributes.  
The idea was to transform raw bank data into actionable insights that can help the bank retain valuable customers.  

---

## 📂 Dataset Details  

- **Source:** Sample bank churn dataset (`churn.csv`)  
- **Attributes include:**  
  - Customer demographics (Age, Gender, Geography)  
  - Credit Score, Balance, Number of Products  
  - Tenure, Estimated Salary  
  - Target: Churn (Yes/No)

## ✨ Project Features  

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding customer patterns  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Scaling features using StandardScaler  
- **Model Training:** Built a **Naive Bayes classifier**  
- **Saved Models:**  
  - `NB_model.pkl` → trained model  
  - `scaler.pkl` → preprocessing scaler  
- **Implementation:**  
  - Jupyter Notebook (`main.ipynb`) for training & evaluation  
  - Python script (`script.py`) for making predictions

## 📸 Project Workflow  

1. Load dataset (`churn.csv`)  
2. Perform EDA and visualize patterns  
3. Preprocess features (scaling)  
4. Train Naive Bayes model  
5. Save model & scaler  
6. Make predictions via `script.py`

## 🎯 Learnings  

- Basics of **data preprocessing** and feature scaling  
- Building and saving ML models (`pickle`)  
- Working with **Naive Bayes** for classification tasks  
- Structuring an ML project (dataset, notebook, script, saved model)

## 🤝 Final Note  

This may be a simple churn prediction project, but it’s an important step in my **machine learning journey**.  
I’ll continue improving and expanding it with more advanced models and deployment features 🚀
